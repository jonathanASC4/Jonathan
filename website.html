            <p>Our great nation's spiciest press secretary, the Spiceman kicked off his career as press secretary with telling the press that Donald Trump's inauguration crowd was "the largest crowd ever to attend an inauguration, PERIOD," despite the fact that Obama's crowd was visibly larger.</p>
            
            <p>Seriously, it's so goddamn obvious. Look, here's Obama's inauguration crowd:</p>

            <p>And here's "the largest crowd ever to attend an inauguration:"</p>

            <p>Normally, press secretaries correct themselves when they tell a lie so obvious, and memory of it gradually fades as their dignity slowly restores. Unfortunately for Sean, he worked for the most delusionally egotistical president ever to somehow get elected, so Kellyanne Conway, President Trump's campaign manager, rushed to his defense, saying that he did not lie, but rather, told an "alternative fact." Instead of working, it lead to the word "alternative" becoming one of the easiest and most frequently-used jokes against the Trump Presidency. Oops.</p>

            <p>While these were all very entertaining, they're hardly the only jokes about Spicer we had. There were a list of things about the man to mock, not all of which were even related to his performance as press secretary.</p>

            <p>Despite making a living off of talking to crowds, Spicer apparently has difficulty with pronunciation. He has a long record of mispronouncing words:</p>
